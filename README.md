It looks like you're showing a commit message for a Git repository. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you might want to consider or improve regarding this commit message:

### Current Commit Message

```
- feature: add main.go, go.mod, go.sum
```

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Use Conventional Commit Messages**:

   - Using a clear and consistent format helps maintain a clean commit history. A common format is:
     ```
     type(scope): subject
     ```
   - In your case, you could write:
     ```
     feat: add main.go, go.mod, go.sum
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `feat` indicates a new feature.
     - The scope (optional) could specify the module if needed (e.g., `core`, `ui`).

2. **Add More Context**:

   - If possible, provide a bit more detail about what the feature is or what changes were made. For example:
     ```
     feat: add main.go for application entry point, add go.mod and go.sum for dependency management
     ```

3. **Use Bullet Points for Multiple Changes**:
   - If your commit includes multiple changes, using bullet points can enhance readability:
     ```
     feat: add application structure
     - main.go: entry point of the application
     - go.mod: dependency management
     - go.sum: checksum for module versions
     ```

### Summary of Best Practices for Commit Messages

- **Be concise but descriptive**: Clearly explain what the commit does.
- **Use the imperative mood**: Write commit messages as if you're giving a command (e.g., "add" instead of "added").
- **Group related changes**: Keep commits focused on a single purpose or change to simplify future reviews and rollbacks.

By following these guidelines, you can create more effective commit messages that enhance collaboration and maintainability in your projects.
